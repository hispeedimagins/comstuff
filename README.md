# Simple frontend for the steem blockchain for ComedyOpenMic

This static html website is easy to use and cheap to host.

As of now it only does read operations. Write operations will come soon.

It can be used for rapid deployment of a new product using a tag or by an individual for showcasing their blog to the world.

Written using html, css, javascript and react for reusable components.

Thank you for reading.
